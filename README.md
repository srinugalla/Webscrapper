# 🕸️ Webscrapper

> *Some scripts scrape data. This one carries a little sadness with it.*

Webscrapper is a simple Python-based web scraping project built to extract data from the web, transform it into something meaningful, and quietly store it away. It was created during a phase of learning, experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and learning again.

Like many small projects, it doesn’t shout — it works silently in the background, collecting fragments of the internet, one request at a time.
